#' @title Directed metadata graph construction for validation steps
#' @description Build a directed metadata graph from validation routines
#' @param version A character string of the package version (e.g. as returned by \code{\link[utils]{packageVersion}})
#' @param package Validation package. 
#' @param fun Validation function.
#' @param arg.list argument list passed by \code{fun}.
#' @param QualityAspect Class name. Quality Aspect addressed by the Validation. Possible values are 
#' \code{"Bias"}, \code{"Accuracy"}, \code{"Association"}, \code{"Reliability"}, \code{"Discrimination"} and \code{"Resolution"}.
#' @param PredictionGraph metaclipR output containing the Predictions/Projections to validate
#' @param ReferenceGraph metaclipR output containing the reference (observations) 
#' @details This function takes as reference the semantics defined in the Verification ontology defined in the 
#' Metaclip Framework (\url{http://metaclip.predictia.es/}).
